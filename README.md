# velocity.css
Velocity is a css framework with QOL features and advanced tools for positioning, styling, and designing anything.

# Getting Started
## Method 1 - Local
To get started, download the latest compiled version of velocity (this can be found in the `/velocity/style/` folder) As an alternative, you can manually compile the `.scss` using Dart Sass or Live Sass Compiler, which was used during the production of this project.

Once downloaded, move the files into your project and import them.
You can import each file manually if you downloaded the fucntion and
style files seperatly, or you can import the full version.

## Method 2 - URL
To get the latest compiled version of velocity, you can also import the file via Github. You can simply impoirt it by adding this to the begining of your css file or in a css tage:
```scss
@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M1dnight-ofcl/velocity.css/main/velocity/style/velocity.TYPE.css');
```
It should import the latest version.
**Notice! Since velocity is still in development, there is a high chances a classes name will be changed. I try to avoid this at all costs but it is a possibility so make sure to check the changelog, it will have a link with all the classes that need to be replaced.**
