# velocity.css
Velocity is a css framework with QOL features and advanced tools for positioning, styling, and designing anything.

# Getting Started
To get started, download the latest compiled version of velocity (this can be found in the `/velocity/style/` folder) As an alternative, you can manually compile the `.scss` using Dart Sass or Live Sass Compiler, which was used during the production of this project.

Once downloaded, move the files into your project and import them.
You can import each file manually if you downloaded the fucntion and
style files seperatly, or you can import the full version.

The function file contains many useful classes which you can find details on in the documentation. some of these include `occupy-*` which allows an element to take a percentage of it's parent at a side of the parents.

The style file contains styling such as color classes, border-radius classes, ect. Both combined lead to a great coding experience where neither style nor functionality is comprimised; all without needing to write a single line of css.
